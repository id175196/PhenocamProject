Introduction
-------------------
I have made the MATLAB source code  for my color image thresholding method publicly available for research and testing purposes. It based my paper published at Optical Engineering:

Y. Du,; C. Chang, and P.D. Thouin, "An Unsupervised Approach to Color Video Thresholding", Optical Engineering, Vol. 43, No. 2, 282-289, (2004). 

For details of the underlying scientific principles please download my paper, available on the main homepage. More details about each gray-scale thresholding method could be found at my dissertation, which could be available upon request:
Y.Du, Text Detection and Restoration of Color Video Image, Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, (2003). 

It is programmed at MATLAB Release 12.0, Ver. 6.0 and has been tested at MATLABD Release 13.0, Ver. 6.5. All are in Windows Operation System.

Limitations
----------------
The system basically inputs an color image with formats recognizable by the MATLAB, such as JPG, TIF, and PNG. And it outputs a color thresholded image. In this program, you could choose the following methods: OTSU's thresholding method, Local Entropy Method (LE), Joint Entropy Method (JE), Global Entropy Method (GE), Local Relative Entropy Method (LRE), Joint Relative Entropy Method (JRE), and Global Relative Entropy Method (GRE). 

Terms and Conditions
-------------------------
This code is distributed without any warranty. If you use different version of MATLAB, some changes may be necessary.

If you use this code or any portions of the source code in any publications you must make references to it as follows.
